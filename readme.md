# Objective
The object of this code repository is build a classification model to predict quote sales.

# Structure
This repository is uncomplete as the project is no longer relevant. The adopted approach involes building several models using a pipeline to define the best modelling method. Once completed, models are tuned and compared with a baseline.

# Future Learnings
- Ensure that structure uses a feedback loop
- Model can be used for optimisation on a remote server
- Two models: top of screen (probability) and conversion (probability)
- Remember to add context to a problem, what's been done before? Are the dates relevant?
